    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-label chicken">Chicken</div>
      <p>We coat the chicken in a simple seasoning that becomes crispy when pan-fried, then while the chicken is resting we make a 1 minute butter sauce in the same pan so it gets flavour from the residual seasoning. It’s incredibly tasty and incredibly quick!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-label beef">Beef</div>
      <p>This stir fry is packed with strips of beef steak, veggies, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever tasted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-label sushi">Sushi</div>
      <p>If you love sushi, we encourage you to try our sushi, Chirashi-zushi. We prepared it by arranging various ingredients such as seafood, shredded egg omelet, seaweed, and shiitake mushrooms on top of vinegared rice.</p>
